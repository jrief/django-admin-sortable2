django-admin-sortable2
======================

A replacement for django-admin-sortable using an unintrusive approach.

This plugin is a generic drag-and-drop ordering module for sorting objects in the List, the Stacked- and the Tabular-Inlines Views in the Django Admin interface.

This module offers simple mixin classes which enrich the functionality of any existing class derived
from ``admin.ModelAdmin``, ``admin.StackedInline`` or ``admin.TabluarInline``.

Thus it makes it very easy to integrate with existing models and their model admin interfaces.
Existing models can continue to inherit from ``models.Model``. No special base class is required.

News
----
Version 0.5.0 changed its naming convention.

Unfortunately, because both libraries django-admin-sortable and dkango-admin-sortable2, use the same
package name: ``adminsortable``, it is rather difficult if not impossible to use them side-by-side
in the same project during transition. It also means that all of my migration history has to be either
rewritten or discarded, because the existing migrations reference ``adminsortable.SortableForeignKey``,
which does not exist in this package.

Why should You use it?
----------------------
All available plugins which add functionality to make list views for the Django admin interface
sortable, offer a base class to be used instead of ``models.Model``. This abstract base class then
contains a hard coded position field, additional methods, and meta directives.

This inhibits to create sortable abstract models. **django-admin-sortable2** does not have these
restrictions.
